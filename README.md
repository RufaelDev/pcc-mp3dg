The Point Cloud Library (PCL) is a standalone, large scale, open project for 2D/3D image and point cloud processing.

PCL is released under the terms of the BSD license, and thus free for commercial and research use. We are financially supported by a consortium of commercial companies, with our own non-profit organization, Open Perception. We would also like to thank individual donors and contributors that have been helping the project.

This specific fork includes benchmarking tool (compression_eval), a quality metric (quality) and a novel codec implementation as base for MPEG activities on point cloud compression (cloud_codec_v2)
Aim is to further develop the point cloud compression in MPEG and contribute it back to the pcl community. For further information contact rufael mekuria rufael.mekuria@cwi.nl
